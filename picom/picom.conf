#          Animations (Fast)    #
#################################
# Picom configuration
# Purpose: Speed up animations and fades for snappier feel.
# - Removed `show`/`hide` triggers (prevents desktop-switch animations).
# - Reduced animation durations and transition lengths.
# - Increased fade steps for faster fades.
#
# requires https://github.com/jonaburg/picom
